    nearest_spd(A)

Return the nearest (in Frobenius norm) Symmetric Positive Definite matrix to `A`.

Based on [answer in MATLAB Central forum](https://de.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/320134-make-sample-covariance-correlation-matrix-positive-definite).
From Higham: "The nearest symmetric positive semidefinite matrix in the
Frobenius norm to an arbitrary real matrix A is shown to be (B + H)/2,
where H is the symmetric polar factor of B=(A + A')/2."

# Arguments
`A`: square matrix

# Returns
`Ahat`: nearest SPD matrix to `A`
